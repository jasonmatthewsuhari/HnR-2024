# HnR 2024
 Jason Matthew Suhari's individual submission for HnR 2024. The concept is to make some sort of desktop simulation where there's a primary failstate you have to avoid (I don't know, maybe you're rushing to do an assignment?) and you're constantly being disrupted by popups and notifications. I was inspired by games such as There Is No Game and weirdly enough, Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.

 Some of the pixel art assets were taken from itch.io (credited accordingly, further down in this file and in the game itself as well hopefully), but I am planning on making some of the pixel art assets myself -- can't find any pixel OS windows. The first step is to make the disruptors: the windows. I got the drag-and-drop working, but now I need to make it so that the player can actually delete the windows (and later on, make it so that the windows function like actual windows).

 The way I'm going to do this is probably by generating a separate delete button that just follows the window around.
