# HnR 2024

 Jason Matthew Suhari's individual submission for HnR 2024. The concept is to make some sort of desktop simulation where there's a primary failstate you have to avoid (I don't know, maybe you're rushing to do an assignment?) and you're constantly being disrupted by popups and notifications. I was inspired by games such as There Is No Game and chaos-games such as Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.

I sincerely hope you enjoy the experience, although the game is not even half of what I envisioned it to be :')
