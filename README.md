# HnR 2024
 Jason Matthew Suhari's individual submission for HnR 2024. The concept is to make some sort of desktop simulation where there's a primary failstate you have to avoid (I don't know, maybe you're rushing to do an assignment?) and you're constantly being disrupted by popups and notifications. I was inspired by games such as There Is No Game and weirdly enough, Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.
